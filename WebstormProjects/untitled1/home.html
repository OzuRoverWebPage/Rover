    I conducted my internship in software development at Mebitech Bilişim A.Ş. I assisted my completed project during internship. This project was named Meziy for Konya Metropolitan Municipality Fuzz Presidency. Project aimed that all procedure will be taken from manual system to electronic system. Fuzzes will be able to take a penalty receipt from pocket printer by writing information to their tablet. To do so, we analyze fuzz’s necessities for all process. I used hibernate framework for database, HTML-CSS-JavaScript for portal which is ui side, java for backend. During the internship, I acquired lots of skills and experiences such as making web page, connection between ui side and backend, keeping a database, libraries and frameworks. Additionally, this internship improved my personal skills and professional skills such as being in a large project, problem solving, researching etc. Moreover, I realized my weakness and strengths for professional life during internship.


    I. Introduction

    Basically, I assisted engineers in software development department for Meziy Project. First times, I didn’t know anything about ui side. There were lots of languages, frameworks and libraries to learn. These languages were HTML, CSS and JavaScript and frameworks were hibernate, Bootstrap, Kendo ui, dropwizard and lastly libraries were JQuery, IText, Maven. For that, I spend 2 weeks to learn these languages from codeacademy.com . After learning, I created lots of portal screen and connection with database. In these screens, chief of fuzzes will be able to register fuzzes information and their works. Below screen is a example of these screens.
